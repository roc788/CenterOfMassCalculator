# CenterOfMassCalculator

Calculates the "center of of mass" for multiple regions on a two-dimensional plane based on the minimum cell value threshold.  Create a two-dimensional array in the Main() function and pass that array, along with a threshold value, to the function to retrieve a list of coordinates for the center of masses.
